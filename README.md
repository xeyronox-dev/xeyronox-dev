## 👁️ About Me
I build practical automation and security tooling focused on **financial logic** and reliable workflows. My work targets the kinds of logic errors and process gaps that cause real financial loss — not just theoretical vulnerabilities.

Core strengths:
- **Python automation** — CLI utilities and data pipelines for finance workflows  
- **Linux & VMware lab engineering** — RHEL-like (Fedora) environments and Kali-based testing VMs  
- **Business logic security** — auditing workflows to detect logic gaps and automation failures  
- **Professional habits** — clear documentation, robust error handling, and reproducible releases

Current focus:
- Deliver dependable automation utilities for financial operations  
- Strengthen Linux system skills and lab engineering for secure experiments  
- Expand systems programming skills with **Rust** and **C**, and frontend knowledge with **React**  
- Deploy secure demo/web results behind Cloudflare and reliable backends via Supabase/Vercel

## ⚙️ Tech Stack 
**Core**
- Python (automation, scripting)  
- Bash (automation & ops)  
- Linux (Fedora / RHEL-style)  
- VMware Pro (lab and snapshots)  
- Git & GitHub (source control, CI/CD basics)  
- Cloudflare (edge security, DNS, basic WAF)

**Learning / Expanding**

## 🖼 Professional Lab Architecture
The diagram below represents my setup details.

**Diagram summary**:
- Host machine (Windows 11 / Dev host) runs VMware Workstation Pro  
- Two lab VMs: **Kali Linux** (testing & tooling) and **Fedora Workstation** (RHEL-like dev/hardening)  
- Optional automation server VM to run scheduled Python jobs and testing harnesses  
- Public-facing demo endpoints served on Vercel / Supabase, protected through Cloudflare (DNS, HTTPS, page rules, WAF)
