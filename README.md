## 👁️ Professional Summary
I design and build practical automation and security tooling focused on financial logic, reliable workflows, and reproducible infrastructure. My work targets logic errors, process gaps, and automation failures that can cause real financial loss. I deliver clear documentation, robust error handling, and production-minded releases.

Core strengths:
- Python automation — CLI utilities, data pipelines, and tooling for finance workflows
- Business logic security — auditing workflows and identifying logic and process vulnerabilities
- Linux & lab engineering — building RHEL-like (Fedora) environments and Kali-based testing VMs
- Professional practices — testable code, reproducible builds, and thorough documentation

Current focus:
- Shipping dependable automation utilities for financial operations
- Strengthening Linux system and lab engineering skills for secure experiments
- Expanding systems programming with Rust and C, and building dashboards with React
- Deploying secure demos behind Cloudflare with reliable backends on Supabase/Vercel
